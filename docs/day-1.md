# Day 1 - December 4th 2025
So I have decided to create a gameboy emulator from scratch with a programming language that I have no experience in. To
be honest, I don't know where to start, but I guess I need to figure out where to start and what to start on. Ideally
I'd like to map out a small lay of the land.

# Where do I start?
I guess I got my work cutout short by this video [Building a GameBoy Emulator: Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCHlyX2sFN8&t)
but then he also mentioned that I should figure this all out. Ehhh it helps to get started with something so that I can
actually do something and get some momentum into building this thing.

# Starting with RGBASM
I guess I start with implementing the assembly code needed for the emulator.
