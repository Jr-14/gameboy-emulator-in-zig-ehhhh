# Day 7 - December 25th 9:54PM
I'm trying to understand how memory and memory address works. I may have the misconception that memory addresses and
their corresponding memory width is like an array that has a bit associated to it. Here's the diagram below.

MemAddr | Stored?
0x0000  | 1
0x0001  | 0
0x0002  | 1
0x0003  | 0
0x0004  | 1
0x0005  | 1
0x0006  | 0
0x0007  | 1

I need to sharpen my understanding, and in doing so I stumbled upon this stackoverflow article about
[How many bytes of data can be stored in a single memory address](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62867683/how-many-bytes-of-data-can-be-stored-in-a-single-memory-address)
