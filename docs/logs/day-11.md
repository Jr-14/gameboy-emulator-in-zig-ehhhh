I'll do a lot more load instructions today. I need to get better at time keeping.

Train of thought - why are load instructions much easier to implement? I don't have to worry about the
flags register, and with further understanding memory, reading the operand makes sense.

**Total time: 120 minutes** Still a lot more 8-bit load instructions to go! :D
