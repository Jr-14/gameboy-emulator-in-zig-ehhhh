I'll do a lot more load instructions today. I need to get better at time keeping.

Train of thought - why are load instructions much easier to implement? I don't have to worry about the
flags register, and with further understanding memory, reading the operand makes sense.

**Total time: 120 minutes** Still a lot more 8-bit load instructions to go! :D

# Day 11 Part 2 - December 28th 5:32PM
Just some more load instructions. I've been thinking and reading about how flags register works and came across this
article [Flag register in 8085 microprocessor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-architecture/flag-register-8085-microprocessor/)

I'll need to implement flags register as part of the other instructions.

**Total time: 25 minutes**
