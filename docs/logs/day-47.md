Committing the DAA instruciton, I need ot update the tests though.

I really think I should learn more about structure packing, found an interesting article called
[The Lost Art of Structure Packing](http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/) since I remember
from my code review about packed unions, packed structs, as well as enum array.
