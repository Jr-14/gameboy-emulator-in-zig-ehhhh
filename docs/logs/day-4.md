# Day 4 - December 7th 2025 9:45AM
Another day trying to implement some more instructions. I'm look at this one
**LD (BC) A** - store the content of register A in the memory location specified
by register pair BC. Maybe I can't implement this yet because I've not implemented
working memory? Or maybe I work on the memory component at the same time so that
I can have a fully working test suite?

I still need some more technical documentation for understanding the inner workings of the gameboy memory map,
and I found this resource [GameBoy Memory Map](http://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/asmmemmap.html). Still have to fully
read through it and see how well it goes
