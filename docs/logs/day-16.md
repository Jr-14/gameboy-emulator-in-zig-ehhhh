Trying to impelement addign a signed integer to an unsigned interger based on the LD HL, SP+s8 instruction

A bit stumped but I think I have the resources required.

Just an aside, I've finally understood about [zig's funky syntax](https://www.openmymind.net/Zigs-weird-syntax/#) `(.{}){}`.

And more resources I've found about carry bits
[Gameboy Half Carry](https://www.robm.dev/articles/gameboy-half-carry/)
[game-boy-what-constitutes-a-half-carry](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8868396/game-boy-what-constitutes-a-half-carry/8874607#8874607)

It's really fun going through the searches and reading them. I can probably find it much quicker through LLM's
but the point of it going through the struggle is to really really think deeply, and struggle through the problem
before getting through a solution.
