# Day 10 - December 27th 9.35PM
I've started to read more of the pseudocode from the Complete Technical reference and it's helping a lot more now.
I don't know why I didn't try to read and understand that first...

I think implemented the 8 bits load is pretty doable now.

**Update - completed at December 28th *12:45AM***
I implemented a lot of 8 bit load instructions. Forgot to update this log at least and how many minutes

**Total time: 123 minutes**
