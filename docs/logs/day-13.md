# Day 13 - December 30th 9.09AM
Let's lock in, more load instructions, I wanna finish it already...

Total time: 130 minutes

# Day 13 Part 2 - 8.40PM
And with that I think I have completed all 8-bit load instructions and with tests :)
Let's just hope I don't have to refactor too much hehe.

Maybe time for 16 bit load instructions?

Total time: 33 minutes
