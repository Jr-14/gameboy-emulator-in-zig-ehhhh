# Day 3 - December 6th 2025 8:59AM
So I had to learn some zig, especially around memory allocation strategies.
Very cool watch. Now I gotta get down to writing some code

# Emulating The CPU - Instructions
I guess we can emulate part of the CPU instructions by using a large switch
statement based on the op code.

When coding, these questions are always on my mind.

Is the implementation correct?
What's the best way to test?
What are the assertions for my test?

I guess I've written the first 32 8-bit instructions. I'm going to try to implement
them and write some tests.
