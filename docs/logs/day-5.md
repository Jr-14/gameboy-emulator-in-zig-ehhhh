# Day 5 - December 15th 8:42PM
Welp, I haven't touched much of the game boy dev repo. No excuses, but I've been doing
some advent of code (using zig) so that I can be more familiar with other parts of the
language like reading IO from file, arrays, and some other fun stuff

I've been reading some technical docs, and found that there's another technical reference
[*The Pandocs*](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)

Will be going through this today along side with [GameBoy Memory Map](http://gameboy.mongenel.com/dmg/asmmemmap.html)
to implement memory. From my knowledge of OS, virtual memory is implemented via [page tables and
page frames](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/virtual-pages-page-frames). I wonder how I'll be going to implement that

Oh yea, I also managed to get myself the `.gb` file for tetris. I think it's a good idea to understand and disassemble
this.
