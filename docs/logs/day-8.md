# Day 8 - December 26th 8:34PM
I'm going to attempt to implement the instruction for loading and storing at a memory address now.

**9:18PM**
Reading through the Gameboy complete technical reference - I see that we should probably be reading from the
IR register to determine the instruction

**10:56PM**
Didn't get through too much but trying to understand zig unions and structs again

Total time: 50 minutes
