# Day 2 - December 5th 2025 8:44PM
Maybe it makes sense to also log how many minutes I've spent on this repository.
However, there are also times spent outside of this repository for example, reading
documentation on the train about the full technical documentation for the GameBoy.
But for now it makes sense to log when I sit down in front of my device to code,
or work on the repository.

# Where was I?
I'm trying to get my ahead around implementing the assembly code needed for the emulator...
What sort of interface do I even need to create?
What are the tests I need to run?
