# Day 20 - 2026 January 6th 9.08PM
I want to completely finish implementing `LD HL, SP+s8` instruction tonight!

10.26PM I think I've completed all 8-bit and 16-bit load instructions :D

I've started on 0x18 JR s8 instruction, going to be doing more of the control flow instructions :D

** Total time: 112 minutes**
