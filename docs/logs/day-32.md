It's time for 8-bit arithmetic instructions :D

A bit concerned whether my implementation for addOffset is correct, and
whether I'll be able to implement a decent abstraction for addition with carry and half carry for now. But I know that
refactoring will always happen later.

For the first time, I've also asked for a code review of my current code as of the commit previous to this! Thank you
to the zig community in Discord. Looking to also ask around in ziggit. :)
