# GameBoy Emulator in Zig ehhhh?
Why the hell not? Why do I want to keep making projects, and yet another one in a language I don't know?
What could possibly go wrong??

# Why
To really struggle and understand something deeply. In other words, no cheating with AI/LLM generative content. None of
the source code will be written by an LLM nor will I consult any large language models. This includes, AI responses
from search engines, LLM web interfaces, etc. It's entirely possible that I may stumble upon a blog post, a forum answer
that's been generated by an LLM, but the main idea is that I have to search, read it, and determine the validity of the
answer with my own critical thinking.

Also because [System of Levers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy2yY5a1Z-0) told me I should make a GameBoy emulator.
